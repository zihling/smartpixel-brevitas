# Smart Pixel - Brevitas

This repo re-implements and trains edge NNs using quantization-aware training techinques (Brevitas). Built for Arbolta.

# Models

Models used in this repo based on [edge-nns](https://github.com/KastnerRG/edge-nns.git). Instead of original [fkeras](https://github.com/KastnerRG/fkeras.git), these models are built based on PyTorch and quantisized using [Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas.git).

# Dataset

Smart Pixel dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~oweng/smart_pixel_dataset/).
